Some people show no signs of significant improvement from taking antidepressants, and brain stimulation has emerged as an effective option. According to one personal anecdote from an anonymous University of Massachusetts Psychology undergrad, after undergoing a one-month Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) treatment, she experienced a 50% improvement in her depression symptoms. A peer-reviewed study by John P. O’Reardon and company titled Efficacy and Safety of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in the Acute Treatment of Major Depression: A Multisite Randomized Controlled Trial focuses on answering the question: how effective is TMS in treating major depression? 

According to Mayo Clinic, Major Depressive Disorder is categorized as a mood disorder that induces continuing feelings of sadness and a loss of enthusiasm (Depression, 2018). The disorder affects how people think, behave, and experience life, and this can cause various physical complications such as substance abuse, weight excess -- which can lead to heart problems, self-mutilation, or pain and physical illness. Depression can lead to emotional problems such as anxiety, panic disorder, social isolation, or self-deprecating thoughts. An individual may lose the motivation for regular daily activities and can potentially think their life is not worth living (Depression, 2018).

TMS discharges a time-varying current with an insulated coil placed on the outside of the scalp. The current creates a quick magnetic field that the scalp and skull are transparent to. When the flow of current reaches a conductive medium in the brain, it reaches the potential to modify neural circuitry in a productive way (O’Reardon 2007). Researchers of the study conducted a double-blind study with 301 participants who were patients not taking medication to treat their clinical depression. The study used two randomized conditions, and 155 participants were assigned to the active TMS group. The other 146 participants were assigned to a sham TMS group. Five sessions of TMS were performed per week at “10 pulses/sec, 120% of motor threshold, 3000 pulses/session, for 4-6 weeks (O’Reardon 2007).

Assessment was conducted using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Results found the active TMS group was far more successful than the sham TMS condition on the MADRS (O’Reardon 2007). Patients saw noticeably higher response rates with active TMS on both scales, including the HAMD17 and HAMD24 with their 17 and 24-item rating scales, respectively. Remission rates were twice as high with active TMS at week 6 and showed a significant change on the MADRS and HAMD24 scales, but not the HAMD17 scale (O’Reardon 2007). There were low dropout rates with active TMS of (4.5%) and pain was reported as mild and limited to transient scalp discomfort. 

Researchers concluded that TMS had a high efficacy of treating major depression with little reports of any side effects. They viewed it as a novel and alternative treatment for depression in the 2007, as TMS was a newer treatment compared to more longstanding or traditional methods such as antidepressants (O’Reardon 2007).
