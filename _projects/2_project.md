<b>Introduction:</b> <br>
Modern students have to manage sleep duration and deprivation, which can have an effect on perceived stress levels. There are multiple peer reviewed articles that reference the association between sleep and perceived stress or between roommates and sleep. A study in South Korea conducted in 2015 from the Community Health Survey (CHS) emphasizes the importance of workers and college graduates sleeping enough to properly manage stress (Choi 2015). 

A study by Psychology Reports concluded that for 76 college students in the Midwest, the number one reason for not getting enough sleep was being disturbed after getting to bed (Sexton-Radek 2013). We set out to answer the question: how does having a roommate effect sleep duration and perceived stress levels in college students? For our hypothesis, we projected that participants with roommates would experience higher levels of stress and participants who slept less than seven hours per night would experience higher levels of stress.


<b>Method:</b> <br>
There were 301 UMass college students surveyed in a Stress and Health Survey for the study. The students were participants in Psychology 241: Methods of Inquiry in Psychology, taught by Dr. Carolyn Davies, Ph.D. We asked participants were asked to complete an online survey. The study measured a categorical variable: participants with a roommate vs. participants with no roommate. We measured a continuous variable: hours of sleep. Finally, we measured Perceived Total Stress through the Perceived Stress Scale, which is a scale that measures perceived stress levels of one individual participant. 

<b>Results:</b> <br>
As we aim to discover if having a roommate affects sleep duration, and if this impacts perceived stress levels, we take a look at the results from the survey. We used an independent-samples t-test to examine whether levels of perceived stress were higher among those who have a roommate compared to those who did not. Results did not support a relationship between having a roommate and perceived stress levels. Results indicated there was no significant difference between participants who lived alone (M = 22.37, SD = 5.96), and those who lived with others (M = 20.47, SD = 6.87), t = (33) = , p = 0.129. We used a ¬¬¬t-test to test the relationship between perceived stress levels and sleep duration. We found that results did support that the amount of sleep a student gets affects their stress levels. Our correlation coefficient was -0.22 for sleep vs stress.
 



<b>Discussion:</b> <br>
Results of our hypothesis about the effect of sleep duration on perceived stress levels are non-linear, suggesting a possible parabolic relationship between sleep duration and perceived stress levels, as participants experienced higher stress levels if getting too little or too much sleep. This indicates a middle ground may be best when it comes to the effect of sleep duration on perceived stress. This does not support our hypothesis. Our hypothesis that a roommate impacts perceived stress levels was not supported. This may be due to the small sample size and lack of representation of students living alone. 

A limitation of this study are the sample sizes. The data collected from both t-tests is not viable due to the “participants living with roommates” sample size was 274 participants whereas the “participants living alone” sample had only 27 participants. This disproportionate sample of participants would produce a Type 2 statistical error. 

An implication of our results would be to reconduct the study with equally proportional sample sizes. Our results do not support either hypothesis. The correlation coefficient was negative and close to zero, which is non-linear, suggesting there may be a parabolic relationship between sleep and stress, which also does not support our hypothesis. Another limitation to consider is we do not know how many roommates each participant is living with, and number of roommates per household/dorm could have implications on stress levels. Another limitation is many individuals often do not get a consistent average of sleep, which could make it difficult to generalize the results of the study and to produce an accurate mean and standard deviation. 

Our results do not support our hypothesis that participants with roommates would experience higher levels of stress. Our results also do not support that participants who slept less than seven hours per night would experience higher levels of stress. Our results do support that lower sleep duration has a negative impact on stress levels.
