The development of sociability in children as they develop is vital to life. A recent study performed by the Society for Neuroscience in the Journal of Neuroscience targeted oxytocin as the subject of their research, as the hormone is commonly known as the “love hormone (Clark, 2021).” Oxytocin addresses the second Principle of Hormone Action, as the hormone acts by changing the probability of evoked behavior. Oxytocin is released in the brain during social interactions of meaning such as a moment between a child and a parent or a couple in a romantic interaction. The study references oxytocin and its connection to social circuit development by examining its role in zebrafish (Clark, 2021).

Zebrafish have similar evolutionary neural circuity to humans and are highly social animals. Their short lifespan makes them ideal for observing scientifically over a lifetime, so scientists removed specific oxytocin-producing neurons early in fish development to better understand the social development of the Zebrafish (Clark, 2021). Scientists examined the impact of the removal of the oxytocin-producing neurons come adulthood. They tested this by separating one fish from the rest of the group with a clear barrier, and the scientists found that socially healthy solitary zebrafish would remain close to the see-through barrier, as if they wished to participate in the group on the other side. Scientists observed the zebrafish with the oxytocin neurons removed during their early lives were less interested to socialize in adulthood (Clark, 2021). 

On the flip side, removing the same oxytocin neurons while in adulthood had no effect on the social behavior of the fish. This implies that there is a vital developmental window in early development where oxytocin forms the social circuit. Scientists discovered that eliminating the oxytocin in early development also had a negative impact on other cognitive functions, such as attention, reward, and decision-making mechanisms (Clark, 2021). 

These findings show that oxytocin may play an important role in crafting our social characteristics in early development, but further research is necessary to better understand how this is implicated in human behavior.
