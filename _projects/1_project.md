AMHERST – Since 2012 Amherst has been designated as a “Green Community,” part of a state sustainability program. Amherst Town Manager Paul Bockelman and Sustainability Coordinator Stephanie Ciccarello spoke about the Green Communities Program and how it has benefited the town. 

In 2012, Amherst was admitted into the Department of Energy Resources’ Green Communities Program. The state program rewards communities with grants in exchange for following certain criteria, like reducing energy usage by 20 percent in five years. As of today, Amherst has reduced energy consumption but has failed to reach the 20 percent goal by 2017. 
 
The Green Communities Program awards grants to qualifying municipalities to improve energy efficiency. If approved, the town is classified as a “Green Community.” The program has helped 240 communities across the state address climate change by granting over $44 million in funds. 
 
Towns are eligible to apply as a “Green Community” once the town government makes a proposal outlining plans that meet five specified criteria (see image below).

Amherst was one of the first 100 towns to join as a “Green Community” and was awarded 
$302,000 in July 2012 to update all streetlights with LED technology. Two years later in July 2014, $102,541 was awarded to the town to fund energy conservation measures in Town Hall and the North Fire Station. A third grant was awarded in July of 2016 as the town received $175,971 to fund electric vehicle charging stations and a new boiler at the police station. The town plans to apply for another grant during the next application round in 2020. 
 
In early October, students from the University of Massachusetts Amherst met with Bockelman at the town hall. When asked about the impact of the Green Communities Program, Bockelman avoided going into detail. He said the town took advantage of several grants, and he mentioned the new additions to the police station as the most recent project funded by the Green 
Communities Program. 
 
Although these efforts have made a positive impact on energy reduction, the town has yet to hit the 20 percent five-year reduction goal that passed two years ago. Upon questioning, Ciccarello said this is not unusual. 
 
A Green Communities Program progress report in 2018 disclosed only 27 municipalities have achieved the 20 percent energy reduction goal. Just 15 miles away, the town of Palmer was able to reach 41 percent energy reduction five years after their baseline year in 2009.  
 
A Green Communities Program case study reported an estimated total annual savings of more than $55,000 with these new changes for the town of Palmer. The case study mentioned improvements the town made including interior and exterior lighting upgrades, heating, ventilation and air conditioning improvements, more efficient appliances, weatherization, and wastewater treatment system improvements.  
 
Ciccarello said the biggest obstacle in reaching the 20 percent goal is the “ability to secure funding for large projects and sometimes it's challenging to get the decision makers on board when there is competition for financial resources.” 
 
Many other issues besides funding stand in the way of Amherst reaching the 20 percent goal. Extreme weather issues are an area of concern. Expectations of increased precipitation and heat, and extreme weather changes can arise as the climate evolves and requires more energy for humans to survive.  
 
In addition, an increased number of students are committing to the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In fall of 2019, 5,800 first year students were welcomed to the school, the largest first year class in the university’s history. Ciccarello said the demand to charge even more electronics and devices could also be a challenge in the goal to reduce energy. 
 
Overall, the town of Amherst has plans for many funded projects through the Green 
Communities program from efficiency upgrades to new motors. Together, the program and the town are reducing the town’s energy usage and show potential for a new era of energy efficient solutions. 
 
“This program has made Massachusetts a leader and it is my hope that it will continue to create additional programming with even more aggressive carbon dioxide reductions,” Ciccarello said.
